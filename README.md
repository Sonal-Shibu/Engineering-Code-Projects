# NSGA-II
NSGA-II using population based searching to find solution two engineering problem. Where one function is being maximised and the other fuinction is being minimised

/par

Hello, this script will find solutions within the engineering design space. It is for two functions, where one is being maximised and the other is being minimised. Therefore this problem is a 2D function problem. The author has had results with a 3D with code tweak however the results are a mix bag. It is therefore recommended to only use this code for two function problems. More over this code will not plot just give your the parents.

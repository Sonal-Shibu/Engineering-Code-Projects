# Engineering-Code-Projects
Hi I am Sonal, I am an mechanical engineer with a masters from Brunel Univeristy in London. This repository is to aid new comers into the STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathmatics) feild to visual and understand the link between theortical mathmatics/phyiscs to code. Hence, this repository will contain a set of Python 3 codes; breaking down how physics is into actual code by the use of comments. In order to build a bridge from mathmatical theory to real life engineering solvers! 

I have spent a considerable amount of my time in undergrauate studies coding in MATLAB. However, MATLAB has a low avialablity issues and "logic" of MATLAB is not as intuitive as other languages! Therefore I have created the solvers in Python 3 for a few reasons; the logic is pretty straight forward, it's a free program there is no pay wall or none of the modules as numpy or scipy is behind any paywalls and the program in general is light weight compared to MATLAB. The following solvers are going to be written in Python 3 unless explicitly stated and the I will be use Spyder text editor. I also recommend this program because of two wonderfull features, the variable explorer and plot view tab! (If you are transitioning from MATLAB To Python this text editor as a similar layout to MATLAB so the tranisition/ learning curve is not that steep). But any other text editor should work.  

The authpr wants to stress that MATLAB is a great TOOL. The keyword tool, MATLAB has been used to create and simulate wonderfull things just as python. Therefore you are the master painter, the text eidtor is the blank white canvas and your brain / logic are the masterfull brush strokes to create your creation! The only limit is what you're NOT wiling to learn!   

Happy learning!
